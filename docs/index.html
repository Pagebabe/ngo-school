      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Children’s Home of Education is a rural education project built to help children who otherwise have limited access
        to learning opportunities. Many families here are very poor and children often spend their days helping with field work,
        caring for animals, or staying at home without education.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Our mission is simple: help the young Cambodian generation build a better future.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our first focus is to make school number one strong and stable. When it becomes a successful story, we can copy the model.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, we want to support students to continue to public school, reach university, and build careers that help their
        families and communities.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Without stable income, we cannot plan a stable future. That is why monthly support is important.
