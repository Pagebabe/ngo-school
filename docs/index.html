      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Children's Home of Education is a rural education project built to help children who otherwise have limited access
        to learning opportunities. Many families here are very poor and children often spend their days helping with field work,
        caring for animals, or staying at home without education.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Our mission is simple: help the young Cambodian generation build a better future.

      <h2>Why This School Exists</h2>
      <div class="story-content">
        <p>
          <strong>Director Wei Ha</strong> grew up in rural Cambodia without access to education. 
          As a child from a poor family, he remembers: <em>"Nobody gave me even one pencil."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          He spent 15 years as a monk, learning Khmer, English, Thai, and Japanese. 
          After working with human rights organizations, he knew he wanted to share knowledge 
          with children who face the same struggles he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          With support from friend Thomas Van Lienders (Belgium), who helped purchase land, 
          the school was born. Today it serves 160 children who would otherwise have no access 
          to English education or stable learning.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          <strong>"I know what it means to have nothing. That's why I do this."</strong> — Wei Ha
